Explainable & Accountable Blockchain-Assisted Federated IDS with Compact Audit Trails

Problem:
Operators need verifiable reasons for automated alerts and a compact, tamper-evident audit trail for each model update and decision; current BFL systems record updates but lack explainability and lightweight auditability.

Why it’s novel ?

Store compact commitments + explainability metadata (e.g., SHAP summary or feature-importance hashes) on a permissioned blockchain. Combine digital signatures for authenticity and a redaction-aware policy for sensitive metadata, producing an auditable chain of decisions that is both explainable and privacy-respecting. 

Approach (high level)

Clients compute local explanation summaries for model updates (feature importance vectors → hashed summaries).

Commit update hash + explanation hash + signature to blockchain.

On suspicious updates, auditors can request verifiable explainability proofs (off-chain) linked to on-chain commitments.

Optionally support redactable metadata for privacy compliance while keeping immutable proof of the redaction event.

Datasets / Testbed:

CIC-IDS2017, IoT-23 (for IoT IDS), and synthetic traces; implement a prototype that logs explainability commits to Hyperledger Fabric.

Evaluation metrics:
Explainability fidelity, auditability (proof size, verification time), detection accuracy, storage overhead for blockchain commitments.
