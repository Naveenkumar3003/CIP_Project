Cryptography-Based Secure Data Transmission with Blockchain Audit Trail

The Problem:
Data transmitted across networks is vulnerable to interception, modification, and replay attacks. While encryption protects data confidentiality, there is often no reliable mechanism to verify whether data was altered during transmission or to audit communication history.

The Proposed Idea:
Design a Secure Data Transmission Framework where data is encrypted using standard cryptographic algorithms, and transmission metadata is recorded on a blockchain audit trail. Blockchain provides transparency and integrity, while cryptography ensures secure communication between network nodes.

Key IEEE Reference Context:
IEEE Network and IEEE Security & Privacy (2024–2025) discuss secure communication protocols, cryptographic protection, and blockchain-based auditing for distributed networks.

Why it’s Novel:
The integration of secure communication and blockchain auditing provides both confidentiality and accountability, enhancing trust in network data exchange.
